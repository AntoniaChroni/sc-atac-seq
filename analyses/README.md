# How to use analysis modules in the Single cell/Single-nucleus ATAC Seq workflow (ScATACSeq)

This repository contains a collection of analysis modules designed to process and analyze single cell ATAC (scATAC) data from 10X sequencing technology. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Data for testing phase**
  - Control vs condition (min. 3+3 samples)
  - Number of cells? - size of datasets might determined packages/pipelines to be used
  - Single cell/Single-nucleus ATAC?
  - Integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from the same biological system (multiple modalities)
  - Pipeline for same samples but not same cells with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
  - Annotate scATAC-seq cells via label transfer by using scRNA data: cell type annotation
  - Available bulk ATAC-seq data for the same samples () - this could be used for cell type annotation


**Aim**
To characterize the cell landscape of the bone marrow at single cell resolution

Questions to address:
 - Chromatin aaccessibility in the brain of X condition.
 - Chromatin aaccessibility in the brain of X condition per cell type.

  > New method called SnapATAC —that does not require population-level peak annotation prior to clustering. Instead, it resolves cellular heterogeneity by directly comparing the similarity in genome-wide accessibility profiles between cells. We also adopt a technique, ensemble Nyström method20,21, that improves the computational efficiency and enables the analysis of scATAC-seq from up to a million cells on typical hardware.
  > SnapATAC also incorporates many existing tools, such as integration of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq dataset19, prediction of enhancer–promoter interaction, discovery of key transcription factors22, identification of differentially accessible elements23, construction of trajectories during cellular differentiation, correction of batch effect24 and classification of new dataset based on existing cell atlas19, into one single package to maximize its utility and functionalities.

**Analysis modules**
Each module is self-contained and can be executed independently or as part of a larger analysis pipeline. Below is a summary of each analysis module, including whether they are required or optional. Furthermore, the analysis modules should be run in the following recommended order:

1. `cellranger-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for running and summarizing Cell Ranger count for single or multiple libraries.", required=True)

   - [Chromium Single Cell ATAC (Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin) 10X](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/single-cell-atac)
   - [Cell Ranger ATAC](https://software.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/overview/welcome)
   - cellranger-atac/2.1.0 module on St Jude HPC (and older versions as well)
   - [ctg-sc-atac-10x](https://github.com/perllb/ctg-sc-atac-10x): Nextflow pipeline for preprocessing of 10x chromium sc-ATAC data with cellranger. This also includes: `multiQC: Compile fastQC and cellranger count metrics in multiqc report`.
   
   
2. `upstream-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for estimating QC metrics and filtering low quality cells.", required=True)

  - `Peak/Cell matrix`. This is analogous to the gene expression count matrix used to analyze single-cell RNA-seq. However, instead of genes, each row of the matrix represents a region of the genome (a peak), that is predicted to represent a region of open chromatin. Each value in the matrix represents the number of Tn5 integration sites for each single barcode (i.e. a cell) that map within each peak. You can find more detail on the [10X Website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/pipelines/latest/output/matrices).
  - `Fragment file`. This represents a full list of all unique fragments across all single cells. It is a substantially larger file, is slower to work with, and is stored on-disk (instead of in memory). However, the advantage of retaining this file is that it contains all fragments associated with each single cell, as opposed to only fragments that map to peaks. More information about the fragment file can be found on the [10x Genomics website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/pipelines/latest/output/fragments) or on the [sinto website](https://timoast.github.io/sinto/basic_usage.html#create-scatac-seq-fragments-file).
  - `Computing QC Metrics`
  - `Normalization and linear dimensional reduction`
  - `Non-linear dimension reduction and clustering`
  - `Create a gene activity matrix`
  
> 01A_scATAC-Seq_data_Create_Matrice_Assay_Object_v3.R
> 01B_scATAC-Seq_data_Combined_obj_Filter.new_v2.R


  - `03_run_scDblFinder.Rmd`. To identify doublets from secondary motor cortex single-nucleus ATAC-seq datasets, we use single-cell RNA-seq doublets detection algorithm Scrublet

  
3. `integrative-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for Integrative analysis.", required=True)

> 02_scATAC-Seq_data_Integration-across-Modalities
> 03_scATAC-Seq_data_Integration-across-Modalities_RNA_UMAP.R
> 05A_scATAC-Seq_data_Integration-across-Modalities.Subset.Samples.R
> 07_scATAC-Seq_data_Integration-across-Samples.Harmony.R
> 08_scATAC-Seq_data_Integration-across-Samples.Anchors.R

4. `cell-types-annotation` module (description="Pipeline for annotating cell types.", required=True)
  
  - Marker-based annotation
  - Reference-based label-transfer, either scATAC or bulkATAC seq data (see scATAcat method in the **References**)
  - Integration with scRNA-seq: Integrate single-cell ATAC-seq with single-cell RNA-seq data to annotate cell types and identify transcriptional regulators linked to chromatin accessibility changes.
    > How to do Cell type annotation:
       a) **Projection of AML samples onto healthy BM UMAP**
       b) Bridge integration to label cells
       c) Cell type-specific peaks for cell type annotation


5. `peak-calling` module (description="Pipeline for calling peaks.", required=False)

Motif Enrichment Analysis
  - Transcription Factor Binding Motifs: Use tools like chromVAR, Homer, or MEME to search for enriched motifs in open chromatin regions and predict active transcription factors or regulatory proteins in different cell clusters or conditions.
  - Comparing Motifs: Compare motif enrichment across cell populations to identify differentially active transcription factors and co-factors that might drive cell-specific or condition-specific gene regulation.

> Transcription factor footprinting analysis/06_scATAC-Seq_data_Peak_calling.R
> Building trajectories with Monocle 3

5. `differential-accessibility-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for differentially expressed genes.", required=False)
   
   - Identify differential chromatin accessibility between conditions (e.g., disease vs. healthy, treatment vs. control) using tools like edgeR, DESeq2, or MAST (for single-cell RNA-seq).
   - Find differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) to discover regions of the genome whose accessibility changes in response to biological conditions or cell states.
   - [Find differentially accessible peaks between cell types](https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette.html)

> 09_scATAC-Seq_data_DE_Analysis_Combined.R


6. `plotting-genomic-regions-analysis` module. We can plot the frequency of Tn5 integration across regions of the genome for cells grouped by cluster, cell type, or any other metadata stored in the object for any genomic region using the CoveragePlot() function.

> I have done that..?

7. `gene-ontology-enrichment-analysis` module. 

   - Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis was processed with ‘enrichGO’ function (parameters: OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, ont = ‘BP’) of the clusterProfiler package (version 4.4.4). The marker peaks of cell type used as input (FDR ≤ 0.05 & Log2FC ≥ 0.25) were annotated based on proximity to the TSS of the nearest genes.

8. `trajectory-analysis` module

   - Pseudo-Trajectory: Use tools like Monocle or Slingshot to reconstruct cellular differentiation trajectories based on chromatin accessibility. This allows the identification of chromatin dynamics during transitions from one cell state to another (e.g., stem cell differentiation, immune response activation).
   - Cell Fate Decisions: Track changes in chromatin accessibility that correlate with specific stages of differentiation or responses to stimuli.
