# the following parameters are set up as default values and/or are specific for the following modules: 
# `./analyses/fastqc-analysis`
# FASTQ paths to the fastqc files with format: `path1/*R1-R3*.fastq.gz` are extracted from the `metadata_dir`.
# No need to manually define variables

# `./analyses/cellranger-analysis`
