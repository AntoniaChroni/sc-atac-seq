# the following parameters are set up as default values and/or are specific for the following modules: 
# `./analyses/fastqc-analysis`
# FASTQ paths to the fastqc files with format: `path1/*R1-R3*.fastq.gz` are extracted from the `metadata_dir`.
# No need to manually define variables

# `./analyses/cellranger-analysis`
genome_reference_path: "./" #path to genome reference to be used for the `cellranger-analysis` module
cellranger_parameters: "DefaultParameters" # or "ForcedCells8000Parameters" etc
genome_name_cellranger: "GRCm39" #please define the genome of preference for dual genomes. In case for single genomes, please use the same as used for `genome_name`.

# `./analyses/upstream-analysis`
